    <p>A veggie omelet makes a filling and nourishing meal, 
        whether it's for breakfast, lunch or dinner. 
        Eggs and veggies complement one another through the nutrients they provide. 
        Eggs supply quality protein and vitamin B-12, 
        while veggies contribute vitamins C and K.</p>
